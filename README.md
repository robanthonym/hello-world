# hello-world
It's my first time!
Hello everyone! I am new to programming world. My intentions on using this website is ro get familiar with coding and learning from others about computer science. I do plan on making projects, maybe even making projects with any partners who will like to help me. I am currently in college (1st year) studying computer science and earning my way towards a bachelors degree.
